\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, we present a general algorithmic framework for lifting 
the model search and conflict analysis procedures in satisfiability 
solvers to template-based abstract domains.  We instantiate this framework 
as a novel program analyser, called {\em Abstract Conflict Driven Learning 
for Programs}, that operates over a template polyhedra abstract domain to 
determine safety of C programs. To this end, we present an {\em abstract 
model search} procedure that uses a parameterised abstract transformer 
to flexibly control the precision and efficiency of the deductions in 
the template polyhedra abstract domain. 

%\tmcmt{Hang on!  I thought the model search procedure was GENERAL, and 
%not hard-wired to be the template domain.}
%while performing lazy 
%closure operations in the relational domains for efficiency reasons.
%
The underlying expressivity of the abstract domain helps our decision 
heuristics to exploit the high-level structure of the program for making 
effective decisions.  The {\em abstract conflict analysis} procedure learns 
abstract transformers over a given template following a UIP computation.
%\tmcmt{Hang on! I thought conflict analysis was ALSO GENERAL.}

Experimental evaluation over a range of benchmarks shows that ACDLP is 
more efficient than a SAT-based BMC technique in terms of total number of 
{\em decisions}, {\em propagations}, {\em conflicts} and {\em backtracking} 
iterations and has higher precision compared to an abstract interpreter.

%as well as the precision of the CDCL architecture.  \tmcmt{I don't understand this ``as well as'' business. Do we mean ``without giving up the precision of...''?}
%\Omit{
%The ACDLP analyses in this paper perform bounded model checking. Since we use abstract 
%domains, however, we will be able to extend it to unbounded verification, a possibility 
%we intend to explore in future work.
