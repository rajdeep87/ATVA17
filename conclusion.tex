\section{Conclusions}

We present a general algorithmic framework for lifting the
model search and conflict analysis procedures in DPLL-style satisfiability
solvers to program analysis.  We embody these techniques in a tool, ACDLP,
for automatic bounded safety verification of C programs over a template
polyhedra abstract domain.

We present an \emph{abstract model search} procedure that uses a
parameterised abstract transformer to flexibly control the precision and
efficiency of the deductions in the template polyhedra abstract domain.  The
underlying expressivity of the abstract domain helps our decision heuristics
to exploit the high-level structure of the program for making effective
decisions.  Our \emph{abstract conflict analysis} learns abstract
transformers over a given template following a UIP computation. 
Experimental evaluation over a range of benchmarks shows a~20x reduction in
the total number of \emph{decisions}, \emph{propagations}, \emph{conflicts}
and \emph{backtracking} iterations compared to CBMC.  Moreover, ACDLP
is~1.5x faster than CBMC.  Compared to Astr{\'e}e, ACDLP solves twice as
many benchmarks and has much higher precision.  In the future, we plan to
extend our framework to unbounded verification through invariant generation.

%The ACDLP analyses in this paper perform bounded model checking. Since we use abstract 
%domains, however, we will be able to extend it to unbounded verification, a possibility 
%we intend to explore in future work.
